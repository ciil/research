  quality and distinctiveness, resulting in an analytically

  computationally efficient nonparametric entropy estimator, which
  does not impose any assumption on the probability distributions.
  We propose a partitional clustering algorithm, named
  minCEntropy, to concurrently optimize both clustering quality

  rather intuitive parameters, and performs competitively with

  abstract    = "Abstract Object similarities are now more and more
  characterized by connectivity information available in form of
  network or graph data. Complex graph data arises in various
  fields like e-commerce, social networks, high throughput
  biological analysis etc. The generated interaction information
  for objects is often not simply binary but rather associated
  with interaction strength which are in turn represented as
  edge weights in graphs. The identification of groups of highly
  connected nodes is an important task and results in valuable
  knowledge of the data set as a whole. Many popular clustering
  techniques are designed for vector or unweighted graph data,
  and can thus not be directly applied for weighted graphs. In
  this paper, we propose a novel clustering algorithm for
  weighted graphs, called PaCCo (Parameter-free Clustering by
  Coding costs), which is based on the Minimum Description
  Length (MDL) principle in combination with a bisecting k-Means
  strategy. MDL relates the clustering problem to the problem of
  data compression: A good cluster structure on graphs enables
  strong graph compression. The compression efficiency depends
  on the underlying edges which constitute the graph
  connectivity. The compression rate serves as similarity or
  distance metric for nodes. The MDL principle ensures that our
  algorithm is parameter free (automatically finds the number of
  clusters) and avoids restrictive assumptions that no
  information on the data is required. We systematically
  evaluate our clustering approach PaCCo on synthetic as well as
  on real data to demonstrate the superiority of our developed
  algorithm over existing approaches.",

  interesting sparse patterns like stars. In this paper, we
  propose a novel graph mining technique modeling the transitivity

  exploit these structure primitives for effective graph
  compression using the Minimum Description Length Principle. The
  compression rate is an unbiased measure for the transitivity or
  hub ness and therefore provides interesting insights into the
  structure of even very sparse graphs. Since real graphs can be
  composed of sub graphs of different structures, we propose a
  novel algorithm CXprime (Compression-based exploiting
  Primitives) for clustering graphs using our coding scheme as an
  objective function. In contrast to traditional graph clustering
  methods, our algorithm automatically recognizes different types
  of sub graphs without requiring the user to specify input

  algorithm based on the detected substructures, which increases
  the quality of former methods. Extensive experiments evaluate

  terms of this vocabulary. We measure success in a well-founded
  way by means of the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle:
  a subgraph is included in the summary if it decreases the total
  description length of the graph. Our contributions are
  three-fold: (a) formulation: we provide a principled encoding
  scheme to choose vocabulary subgraphs; (b) algorithm: we develop

  this problem by trying to find sets of simple connection
  pathways between sets of marked nodes. We formalize the
  problem in terms of the Minimum Description Length principle:
  a pathway is simple when we need only few bits to tell which
  edges to follow, such that we visit all nodes in a group.
  Then, the best partitioning is the one that requires the least
  number of bits to describe the paths that visit all the marked
  nodes. We prove that solving this problem is NP-hard, and
  introduce DOT2DOT, an efficient algorithm for partitioning
  marked nodes by finding simple pathways between nodes.
  Experimentation shows that DOT2DOT correctly groups nodes for
  which good connection paths can be constructed, while
  separating distant nodes.",
